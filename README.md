# Off-Chain Reputation System Using Tableland

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an innovative off-chain reputation system, developed as part of a grants program with [Tableland](https://www.tableland.xyz). The system leverages Tableland's unique approach to managing SQL databases off-chain, with smart contracts ensuring proper read/write access.

The primary goal of this reputation system is to facilitate a trustworthy and efficient marketplace-like protocol, where users can leave both public and private reviews for each other, similar to systems used in platforms like Uber or Airbnb. This ensures that transactions are not only verifiable but also that participants are held accountable through a reliable reputation mechanism.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Ensures secure and authorized access to the off-chain SQL database.
- **User Interface**: For users to easily write and view reviews.
- **Public and Private Review System**: Similar to established marketplace models, providing a comprehensive reputation framework.
